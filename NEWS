Version 0.1.1
=============

First tagged release.

This version should be usable for CMIP5 DRS validation and directory
structure deduction.  Many details of the controlled vocabularies are
still to be confirmed (see #!TODO sections in the code).

CMIP3 -> CMIP5 translation is still in development but is close to working.

The API is subject to change but will be stabilised at v0.2.
