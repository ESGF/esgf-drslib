* Check the product of existing PublisherTrees.  This will use the checker framework

* Check consistency of p_cmip5 with esgcet.  See branch check_product for first steps.

* Reconstruct symbolic links from structure only containing
   */files/*.  See branch drs-reconstruct.
   - Summarise checks better in drs_tool
   - switch on/off checks
   - Implement fixes for each check
   - Conservative datestamp overlaps: always promote a file if it contains some relevant data

* Fix for Python 2.5.2 (try/except "as" doesn't work)
* Check support for non cmip5 activity (e.g. pmip3)
 
* Update documentation
  - Check drslib/config.py and add all new features to docs
  - Add section on checksum calculation
  - Add section on reconstruction

* Clean up configuration of product detection

We should be able to set the p_cmip5 handler in metaconfig.conf or
turn on/off product detection there.

* Clean up different project/activity options
