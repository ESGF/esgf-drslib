The configuration file (sample in ini/ukmo_sample.ini) needs to contain information about each model. This information is used for a small number of cases and the format is not yet stable. 

The current default is to use relative paths for the shelves which contain information about the requested subset. This should probably be altered to use abolsute paths relative to a directory specified on installation.
